# Automated Music Subway Maker

A web app that lets build your own artist based subway map!

You've always wanted to have your favorite artists printed on a subway map?
Write a few artist names on the map and press the button "Go Magic" to fill the rest!
Export and print it on a T-shirt and show your music preferences in a creative way!

You can edit the map manually, or automatically, by retrieval of artists similar to the seed artist you have provided.

Additionally, you can preview the music of each artist in the map, check its biography or listen to in Spotify (if you have subscribed to it).

This web application makes use of the Echo Nest API to retrieve music information and the Spotify Web API to play track previews.
