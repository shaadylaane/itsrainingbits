# Automated Music Subway Maker

You've always wanted to have your favorite artists printed on a subway map?

This web app lets you build your personalized artists-based subway map!

Write at least one artist per subway line and press the button "Go Magic" to fill the rest!

The motto is: Proximity rhymes with Similarity!

Export and print your work on a T-shirt and show to the world your music preferences in a creative and fashionable way!

Additionally, you can preview the music of each artist in the map, check its biography or listen to in Spotify (if you have subscribed to it).

This web application makes use of the Echo Nest API to retrieve music information and the Spotify Web API to play track previews.
